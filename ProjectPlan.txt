This is the project plan for the Password Hash Calc in Python CLI.
- See about upgrading SHA calculations to SHA3.
-- Need to research if SHA3 has beem implemented in python3. 
-- https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html
-- According to the above documentation it is available and I can use it as I use hashlib
--- Probably need to think about having it as an option, do you want to use
--- sha2 or sha3? That way if any pw are using sha2 can still get those hashes to match.
--- sha3 will produce a totally different hash from sha2.
